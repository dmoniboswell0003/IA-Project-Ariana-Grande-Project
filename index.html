   <p> Having a fan base is one thing but having a fan club named after a fanbase is one thing Ariana Grande has achieved. I made this to showcase Ariana Grande and how outstanding she is to have more people join the club. Expand the fanbase if you will. This website is dedicated to people to see Ariana as the fanbase and fan club see her. I am proudly a part of both.</p>
